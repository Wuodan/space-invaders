# Product Specification: Space Invaders Clone

## Overview
This project builds a browser-based implementation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game, utilizing an agent-based autonomous development workflow to demonstrate collaborative software engineering principles.

## Core Requirements

### Game Mechanics
- **Player Control**: Move player ship left/right using keyboard/arrow keys
- **Shooting**: Fire projectiles at enemies using spacebar
- **Enemies**: Grid of invaders moving side-to-side, descending over time
- **Collision Detection**: Projectile hits, enemy bullet hits, player-enemy collisions
- **Lives System**: Player starts with 3 lives, loses on enemy-bullet hit or enemy contact
- **Scoring**: Points earned by destroying enemies (increasing points as waves advance)
- **Game States**: Start screen, gameplay, game over screen
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Enemy speed increases over time, more aggressive behavior

### Technical Specifications
- **Browser-Based**: Runs entirely in web browser without external dependencies
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Graphics rendering using HTML5 Canvas 2D API
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive to different screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Audio**: Sound effects for shooting, explosions, and background music (optional)
- **Performance**: Smooth 60 FPS gameplay on modern browsers

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, retro-inspired visual design matching classic Space Invaders aesthetic
- Intuitive controls with on-screen instructions
- Score display, lives counter, and current level indicator
- Game over screen with final score and restart option

### User Stories
- As a player, I want to control my ship to dodge enemy bullets and invaders
- As a player, I want to shoot projectiles to destroy enemies and earn points
- As a player, I want the game to gradually increase difficulty to provide challenge
- As a player, I want clear visual feedback for all game actions

## Architecture

### Subsystems
- **UI Module**: Canvas rendering, controls, game screens
- **Core Logic Module**: Game state management, collision detection, physics
- **Behavior & AI Module**: Enemy movement patterns, bullet patterns, difficulty scaling
- **Scoring Module**: Points calculation, lives tracking, high scores persistence
- **Integration Module**: Interconnects all subsystems into cohesive game

### API Contracts
- Clear interfaces between each subsystem
- Event-driven communication where appropriate
- State management through centralized game state

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Demonstration of safe, non-interrupting autonomous orchestration

## Research Notes
See docs/RESEARCH_NOTES.md for detailed research on Space Invaders mechanics, AI patterns, and previous implementations.

## Out of Scope
- Multiplayer functionality
- Leaderboards beyond local browser storage
- Extra levels or power-ups beyond standard Space Invaders
- Advanced graphics effects (relying on HTML5 Canvas limitations)

## Success Metrics
- Successful automated completion of all development tasks
- Fully playable game meeting all acceptance criteria
- Demonstrated crash-safe development workflow
- Complete documentation of the orchestration process
